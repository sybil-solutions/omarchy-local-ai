# Changelog

Versions follow semver and live in `manifest.json`. Every release is a tag `vX.Y.Z` on `main` and a GitHub release. The marketplace listing only ever targets a tagged release commit. See "Releasing" in `docs/design.md`.

## [6.13.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added
- An install count. When it checks the registry for new models (every 12 hours while the bar runs), Local AI sends `usage.sybilsolutions.ai` a random id made on first run, the plugin version, the card kinds it has recipes for and how many models run. Nothing else: no prompts, no paths, no hostname, and the server keeps no IP address. README, "What Local AI sends", has the details; the counter's code and public totals are at [local-ai-usage](https://github.com/sybil-solutions/local-ai-usage). Turn it off with `omarchy-local-ai set ping off` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1`; a failed send changes nothing.

### Changed
- Recipes from the registry at 0801f2ec: GLM-5.3-Flash with experts on NVMe (55 GB and 16 GB RAM) on an RTX 3090 runs the v4.6-nvme image; the lab accepted the 55 GB recipe at 20.0 tok/s.

## [6.12.7] - 2026-10-09

### Changed
- Agent updates go through mise, which is how Omarchy installs every agent, or through the agent's own updater (claude, omp, hermes, opencode). The plugin no longer runs npm itself: an agent installed some other way says to update it the way it was installed, and is not offered an update the panel cannot run.

## [6.12.6] - 2026-10-09

### Security
- A model card shows no image of any kind. Reference (`![a][r]`), collapsed, shortcut and nested-bracket images became plain links, which load nothing until clicked; before, the full-screen view could fetch a card's image URL, on the internet or the local network, by itself. Reported by HANCORE-linux (omacom/omarchy-plugin-marketplace#10562).
- The Hugging Face token reaches curl through a pipe for every request (model cards, file lists, weights): it is never in an argv and no longer kept in a header file, which is removed if an older version left one.
- A registry refresh brings new recipes, never new code: a catalog that changes the gateway image is refused, and a recipe whose engine image comes from a repository this version's own recipes never use is left out until a plugin update.
- A recipe's name is written into the omp config as a quoted YAML string.
- Downloads are capped: a weight file at its listed size, a Hub file list at 10 MB.
- Notification text drops `<`, `>` and `&`, so an engine log line can never be read as markup.

### Changed
- Recipes from the registry at 1c0b68d0: GLM-5.3-Flash's fast all-RAM mode on an RTX 3090 runs the v4.4 image (a CPU-tier crash fix), accepted by the lab on all six checks at 28.6 tok/s.
- A stale NVIDIA device list says to choose Set up Local AI, which regenerates it, instead of naming a root command.

## [6.12.5] - 2026-10-08

### Security
- The full-screen model card fetch passed the Hugging Face token to curl on its command line, where another local account could read it from /proc/<pid>/cmdline while the request ran. It now goes to curl as a 0600 header file, like the weight downloads; a test keeps the token out of every curl argv. Reported by HANCORE-linux in the marketplace review (omacom/omarchy-plugin-marketplace#10562).

## [6.12.4] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- GLM-5.3-Flash on an RTX 3090 with only 16 GB of RAM and its experts on NVMe, as a reported recipe: the lab passed five of six checks and measured 13.1 tok/s, under the 15 tok/s speed check (registry be35808c).

### Fixed
- "Supported hardware" opens https://local.sybilsolutions.ai/hardware/, the card list; the site's front page is now the landing page.

## [6.12.3] - 2026-10-08

### Changed
- The marketplace listing has a new preview image (the Omarchy dot hands, with the supported cards, harnesses and models) and a shorter description that leads with what Local AI does.

## [6.12.2] - 2026-10-08

### Added
- GLM-5.3-Flash on an RTX 3090 with 55 GB of RAM and its experts on NVMe, accepted by the lab at 17.3 tok/s (registry 532c73ca), beside the reported all-RAM recipe.

### Changed
- Two recipes that would read the same in a table (a model, its format, its card) show what sets them apart in the format column, e.g. "55 GB RAM" against "experts in RAM".

## [6.12.1] - 2026-10-07

### Changed
- A model row says what tapping it does: ⌄ (⌃ while open) on the models tab, where it opens in place, and › on home, where it opens the model's page. An open row is shaded.
- Home lists your models: what is on this machine (running first, then by AA) and the ones you pinned to try. Pin is offered only for a model not on this machine; running or downloading a model no longer pins it.

## [6.12.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- AA: every model's Artificial Analysis Intelligence Index, as a column in every model table, and the models tab ranked by it, highest first (from the registry at d414b407).
- Agent updates are looked up by themselves (backend verb `outdated`: mise, then npm; every 6 hours at most hourly). **Update to <version>** appears only when there is one, and the agents page lists the agents that have one.
- GLM's mark is Z.ai's.

### Changed
- A model's page shows its name once, in the top line with its maker's logo.
- Stop is outlined: no fill, a strong alert border and alert text.
- Agents: the chosen one is checked, the others show nothing; on the agents page choosing an agent makes it the default (no Default agent button).
- Hardware: a line a card (maker, name, temperature, running or free), opening to its memory and where it leads; full screen opens them all. The CPU is its name, threads and RAM.
- The activity grid has no month names or date line under it; a hovered day shows in its top line.
- Full screen and a running model's More are icons. Pinned models carry no downloaded check.

## [6.11.1] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- GLM-5.3-Flash and DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash on an RTX 3090 (with experts in system RAM and an NVMe drive), from the registry at 56621dc9. A recipe its publisher reported but the lab has not yet run says so on its row and its page.

### Fixed
- The panel is never taller than its screen, even when the shell does not say how much room there is; the rest scrolls. A list that gets shorter while scrolled down (a search, a section folded) slides back into view.

## [6.11.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- Two tabs. **Home**: your activity grid (always, empty before first use), running models with Open, More and Stop, your pinned models (else the recommended ones) and this machine. **Models**: every model this machine can run, on whichever of its cards or across several, as one table; type anywhere to search it. A row opens in place to Start or Open and Stop, Download, Cancel or Remove the download, Pin or Unpin, and see Details. Running or downloading a model pins it.
- Multi-card recipes (2×, 4× on one machine). A setup across more cards than the machine has, or one needing more RAM, disk, NVMe or CPU threads, is listed as too big with the reason.
- New backend verbs `download <recipe> [off]`, `pin <recipe> [off]` and `card <recipe>`. The snapshot carries `downloads`, `pins`, each model's `downloaded`, the catalog's commit and age, the CPU's name and threads, and a stale NVIDIA device list (`cdi`).
- `needs.cpus`: the CPU threads a recipe's engine pins work to.
- Full screen: the same views over the whole screen, a year of activity, the model table with engine, context, download, RAM and NVMe columns, and a model's Hugging Face card (pinned revision, cached; no HTML, styles or remote images drawn) with its details open.
- Hardware: the machine in figures (GPUs, VRAM, what runs, RAM, CPU threads, disk), then each card with its maker, memory, temperature and what is on it, and the CPU by name.
- Makers' logos beside every model name (Qwen, Gemma, DeepSeek, GLM, LFM, Hunyuan, Mistral, Nemotron, Step, MiMo; an initial for others) and every card (NVIDIA, Intel, AMD), drawn in the panel's ink (`Logos.js`).
- Back and forward in the top line, Alt+Left/Right and a mouse's buttons; the top line names where you are.
- Keyboard: Up and Down (or Tab) move a ring through everything clickable in screen order, scrolled into view; Enter clicks it. Escape clears the search, steps back home, then closes.

### Changed
- A model's page is its name, one line of what it is doing or why it cannot start, one action (Start; Open and Stop while it runs; Run again and Dismiss after a crash), and the rest under details.
- New models arrive by themselves: the catalog is checked against the registry once it is 12 hours old, at most hourly, and says so only when it brought new ones.
- Stop is a solid alert button everywhere. The agent picker lists each agent once, the chosen one checked.
- A running model's address is hidden until clicked, beside a copy. The registry line, notices and warnings are small banners.
- The no-tested-model screen is a plain home page with this machine's hardware and the supported list.
- A stale NVIDIA device list (a card taken out, a driver update), which makes Docker refuse every start, is named on home with Fix; setup writes it again by reinstalling the toolkit with Omarchy's own commands, and a start through it fails with that reason.
- Recipes: the registry's export now includes every validated model a card lacks and multi-card setups.

### Removed
- The per-card model picker and Config, the AVAILABLE GPU rows, the Refresh button and the Coming soon wave; `qwen.svg`.

## [6.10.1] - 2026-10-07

### Fixed
- Withdraw the Qwen3.8-27B SC3bpw/131k/MTP configuration from eight 16 GB NVIDIA catalog entries after a reported RTX 4070 Ti SUPER load failure with desktop VRAM in use. Sibling cards are held as a precaution until requalified with desktop headroom.
- Existing deployments and their weights remain available. Historical proof records stay in the registry; no untested replacement configuration is offered.

## [6.10.0] - 2026-10-07

### Added
- Schema-3 recipes can prepare generated model packs with the serving image, typed memory/IPC limits and explicit disk budgets. Preparation writes into private staging, verifies output before publishing and checks every reuse.
- Completed packs survive Stop. Remove download protects the frozen paths of running models, including models removed from the refreshed catalog.

### Changed
- Catalog refresh and release sync use a separate v3 export/cache. Older plugins keep their v2 catalog; recipes requiring preparation or typed resources are excluded from v2.
- The gateway uses the public sybil-solutions build, verified against all 42 protocol checks. Existing recipe IDs and model image pins remain stable.
- Registry catalog updates require a normal reviewed release PR; the manual workflow supplies a checked patch instead of writing to main.

### Fixed
- Reject malformed environment values and arguments before building Docker options.
- Cancellation and failed preparation clean up owned containers and staging. Long conversions reserve their selected cards while allowing unrelated cards to start.

No new CPU/NVMe research recipe is promoted by this release. Exact-image hardware, fidelity and speed acceptance remain separate gates.

## [6.9.1] - 2026-10-07

### Changed
- Local AI and its registry now live in the sybil-solutions organization. Installation, model refresh and release checks use the canonical repositories.
- Existing installations retain the sero.local-ai identity, recipe IDs and pinned container images.

## [6.9.0] - 2026-10-03

### Added
- Update any of the nine installed coding agents from Local AI. Updates use the existing installation manager and leave running sessions alone.
- Agent settings use full rows with names and logos, an explicit **Make default** action, and the native folder picker. A running model's configuration page opens its selected agent directly.
- CPU models: x86-64 AVX2 machines can run LFM2.5-2.6B QAD Q4 entirely in system RAM, with no GPU mapping. The registry's six acceptance gates passed at 38.2 tok/s on the tested EPYC host with a 4 GiB container memory limit. Hardware pages show system RAM.

### Fixed
- A model's agent selection no longer silently changes the default for new models. Opening a terminal returns promptly so the panel's action timeout cannot kill a healthy agent.
- Container names are scoped to their owner while existing deployments keep their original names. Concurrent starts serialize their final hardware check and container creation across users; failed unsharing retains its port reservation for retry.
- Usage totals include logs beyond 200,000 requests. Slow Docker removal is retried before an allocation is considered released.
- AMD detection accepts ROCm resolver output and uses numeric video/render group IDs. Unified-memory AMD hardware matches its RAM capacity without treating unknown GPU usage as zero.
- Recipes can select an explicit list of weight files; absolute paths and traversal are rejected.

## [6.8.4] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- Opening pi, omp or Crush wrote the gateway key into the helper's own command line (`jq --arg k`), so another local user could read it from `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` while the helper ran, and the key is never rotated. `jq` now reads the 0600 key file itself (`--rawfile`), and only its path is in the argument list. The adapter test logs every helper argument and fails if the key appears in one, which it did not check before.

## [6.8.3] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- 6.8.2 was not enough for a cold start. On the 13 GB Arc Pro B70 machine, Qwen3.8-27B still faulted the copy engine during shard 2 of 2 (`xe … Fault response: Unsuccessful -ENOENT`, `Engine memory CAT error … class=bcs`, engine reset) with `TreatNonUsmForTransfersAsSharedSystem=0` set: the runtime kept treating the mapped checkpoint as shared-system memory. Intel engines now also start with `EnableSharedSystemUsmSupport=0`. With that set, a cold copy of the whole 15.70 GiB checkpoint onto the card finished with no driver fault.

## [6.8.2] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- On an Arc Pro B70 a start could hang for good halfway through reading the weights (two of three loads of Qwen3.8-27B on a machine with 14 GB of RAM). Intel's runtime let the card's copy engine read host memory in place; it reached an address that was no longer mapped (`xe … Fault response: Unsuccessful -ENOENT`, `Engine memory CAT error … class=bcs`, engine reset) and vLLM waited on the lost copy forever. Intel engines now start with `TreatNonUsmForTransfersAsSharedSystem=0`, so those copies go through the runtime's own staging buffers.

### Changed
- The loading bar is the engine's own progress, not a clock. It used to count from the weights' size (6 s per GB, or the last load's time) and stop at 95%, where a start that had hung stayed for up to 30 minutes. It now shows the step the engine's log reports (reading the weights, file by file; compiling; reserving the cache; capturing graphs; starting the server), the minutes spent, and how long the engine has been quiet.
- A start ends as soon as the GPU driver resets the card under the engine, with the kernel's lines in the log, and after 15 minutes without a line from the engine; before, both waited out the 30-minute limit.

## [6.8.1] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- A start that loaded fine could end in "the model returned no answer": the check asks for 200 tokens, a thinking model can spend them all thinking, and vLLM returns that as `reasoning` with `content` empty, a field the check did not read. Seen with Qwen3.8-27B on a single Arc Pro B70; the check now reads `reasoning` as well as `content` and `reasoning_content`.

## [6.8.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- Setup runs nothing as root itself. It runs Omarchy's Sudoless Docker first (declining it installs nothing), then on NVIDIA `omarchy-pkg-add nvidia-container-toolkit`, and each password prompt names what it is for: "Password for sero to turn on Sudoless Docker for Local AI", "... to install NVIDIA container support for Local AI". Setup no longer edits Docker's configuration, restarts Docker, refuses because other containers are running, sets the Tailscale operator or deletes polkit files: it names the last two when they need doing.
- NVIDIA engines get their cards through the toolkit's CDI list, by UUID (`--device nvidia.com/gpu=GPU-...`), which Docker reads without a restart. An install that already has the `nvidia` runtime and no CDI list keeps `--gpus`.
- The listing: a description and README opening that say what Local AI does in their first line; screenshots, the preview generator and an unused logo are gone from the repository.

### Fixed
- Stop during a start could leave the engine running: `timeout` put the `docker run` it was waiting on in another process group, out of Stop's reach, and the engine came up afterwards with a restart policy. Docker calls now stay in the worker's group.
- The panel no longer breaks on a card kind whose models all need several cards; a model running while setup is needed keeps its card; an action's error clears on the next action or when the panel closes; Refresh models stays disabled until the refresh ends; the panel polls every 5 s, not 1.5 s, while closed during a download; the bar dots use the bar's own foreground; View logs opens at once; long row notes are cut short.
- A `~/.cache` or `~/.local/state` that is a symlink to another disk no longer refuses every start.
- Remove deletes the cache and the images its containers ran, and removes every folder it can before naming any that Docker created as root. A failed stop records why.
- Concurrent writers no longer share temp file names; image pulls may take 2 hours and a start 120 s.

## [6.7.1] - 2026-09-30

### Fixed
- Setup's password prompt says what it is for: "Password for sero to set up Local AI", after a line naming what setup turns on, instead of sudo's bare "[sudo] password for sero". It is the only prompt: setup keeps the password alive while it runs, so a slow NVIDIA package download does not ask a second time.

## [6.7.0] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- "Log out and back in once to finish setting up" is gone, and so is the dead end behind it: the panel showed that note with no button while the account was already in the docker group but the login was older than setup. A login carries the groups it began with, so it could not reach Docker until the next one. The verbs that use Docker now run under `newgrp docker` when that is the case: no root, no password, no logout, and the Docker socket keeps its own permissions (setup no longer sets a socket ACL).
- Whether a model can start is decided in one place (`lib/access.sh`) for the panel, a start and setup alike. Before, three checks disagreed about the NVIDIA runtime, so an NVIDIA machine with the toolkit installed but Docker not configured for it showed no Set up button and refused every start. That state now offers Set up Local AI.
- With Docker stopped, the panel says so and checks again by itself, instead of failing to read GPU use; a failed setup shows its button even while Docker is down.
- A first start shows the engine's download layer by layer ("downloading the engine: 12 of 77 layers"), then "starting the engine", instead of one still line for a pull that can take many minutes (#41, @maralcbr).
- Models survive a reboot: what the engine mounts (a recipe's config file, the by-path links of an Intel or AMD card) now lives in `~/.local/state/omarchy/local-ai/run/`, not in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, which is emptied at every reboot and logout, so an engine that Docker restarted no longer crash-loops on an empty directory (#42, @maralcbr). A model that is running when you update picks up the new path after one stop and start.
- Panel: a model's page counts its own week, not the machine's; a crashed model on a card no row shows gets a row with its reason and dismiss; numbers round before the unit (1M, not 1000K; <0.1 GB, not 0 GB); months stay on their weeks across a daylight-saving change; no `NaN` uptime and no empty format chip for a model whose recipe is gone; Stop does nothing while the model is already stopping; the panel refreshes right after an action; a folder with `|`, `%`, `#` or `?` in its path works (#43, @maralcbr).
- Open keeps working when a registry update renames a running model's recipe: a start keeps the served name, context and vision flag in the model's own config, and a refused Open shows its reason in the panel instead of the panel closing first (#45, @maralcbr).

### Changed
- The snapshot reports `readiness: {state, message}` (`ready`, `needs-setup`, `docker-down` or `unsupported`) in place of `setupNeeded` and `relogin`; `omarchy-local-ai readiness` prints it. Every state has a panel page with a button or one that says it clears by itself, and a test keeps it so.

## [6.6.1] - 2026-09-29

The marketplace listing only; the panel and the backend are unchanged.

### Changed
- The listing's preview is now a 16:9 picture that reads at card size: Local AI and its keyed gateway on 127.0.0.1 in the middle, the logo of every coding agent it opens scattered around it, and the NVIDIA, Intel and AMD logos, each in a circle with an orange line to Local AI. The old one was three panels shrunk into a thumbnail.
- The manifest description is shorter and no longer carries a card count that goes stale with every registry sync. It ends with the start command, `omarchy plugin add https://github.com/0xSero/omarchy-local-ai --enable`, then Set up Local AI in the bar: a listing with a manual-setup override shows its description but no install command of its own.
- The README opens with a Start section: that command and the three steps after it, linking to Install, Requirements and Remove.
- The README now has a Requirements section (Omarchy commands, Docker and the other tools, GPU drivers, optional Tailscale and Hugging Face token, the hosts it reaches), lists exactly what setup runs as root, and states the license. The marketplace asks submitters to document all three, and its security baseline flags the installer, `sudo` and `systemctl` in setup for a maintainer to review against that documentation.

### Added
- `make preview` renders that picture from the agent list in `bin/omarchy-local-ai` and the logos in `docs/preview/logos/` (sources and licences in its README), and checks its own layout (no circle touching another, no line through a circle, every logo drawn and visible); it stops until a new agent has a name, a logo and a spot.
- `test/listing-test.sh` checks the manifest (schema, id, kinds and entry points) and preview against the limits the marketplace enforces, that the README has install, removal, requirements and license sections, and that the start command is in the description and at the top of the README.

## [6.6.0] - 2026-09-29

From an independent audit (Codex, gpt-6-astra) and a click-through of every panel path with cua on a real Omarchy desktop, including a fresh account's setup.

### Added
- **Stop sharing** on a shared model's page.
- Refresh models says what happened: "models up to date · <commit>", or the error.

### Fixed
- A card is in use when any running container holds it, whoever started it: a second model no longer lands on a GPU another account or tool is using (the Arc Pro B70 reports no memory, so this was the only way to see it).
- Setup no longer takes the tailnet operator from another account; sharing says who manages Tailscale when it is someone else.
- A stopped model's page shows why it stopped with Run again, View logs and Dismiss, instead of uptime and a share link that could not work; the reason also shows on its card without opening it.
- Stop keeps the model's state when Docker fails to remove it, and still stops a shared model when unsharing fails.
- An empty file listing from Hugging Face is refused instead of counted as a complete download.
- Every failure shows a reason, including a failed setup, an agent terminal that did not open, and a panel refresh that failed; Docker, downloads and panel actions have time limits instead of waiting forever.
- Long model names no longer run into the fit column.

## [6.5.4] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- After setup, Local AI did nothing until the next login: it borrowed the new docker group through `sg`, which Omarchy does not have, and every call failed. Setup now lets the login it ran in reach Docker directly (the docker group covers later logins), with the same one password. If Docker is still out of reach, the panel says to log out and back in once, and a start says the same.

## [6.5.3] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- A model that fails to start keeps the engine's last 60 lines in its log, and the reason shown names the engine's first error ("the engine did not answer within 30 minutes: RuntimeError: …"). Before, taking the engine down deleted its output, so a timeout said nothing about why.

## [6.5.2] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- A card whose model stopped reads "stopped" rather than "crashed" (often the machine just restarted), and opened it offers View logs and Config: run again and dismiss are already on the row.
- The setup screen says it in one line: once per machine, Docker access and GPU support, a terminal for your password.

## [6.5.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- A model that was loading when the machine restarted no longer shows "starting" forever when its old process number now belongs to another program: it reads "the machine restarted while it was starting", with Run again and dismiss. A worker that died otherwise reads "stopped unexpectedly" (the button already says run again).

## [6.5.0] - 2026-09-29

### Security
- 6.4.0's passwordless start and stop ran this plugin's backend, a file in your home folder, as root: anything running as you could have changed what root ran. Removed. Nothing in the plugin runs as root any more.

### Changed
- Setup is the only password, once per machine: it turns on Omarchy's Sudoless Docker (Omarchy explains it and asks), makes you the tailnet's operator and adds NVIDIA container support when needed. Starting, stopping, sharing, refreshing and removing never ask, and a plugin update never asks for setup again: setup is judged by the machine, not by the version that ran it. No logout is needed; Local AI borrows the new group through `sg` until your next login.
- Setup removes the earlier versions' polkit policy and rule. Refresh models keeps the catalog in your cache instead of a root-owned folder.

## [6.4.0] - 2026-09-29

### Changed
- Setup is the only time you type your password to run models: it installs a polkit rule that lets your account start and stop models without asking while you sit at the machine. Sharing on the tailnet, removing everything and updating the catalog still ask. Updating to 6.4.0 offers Set up Local AI once more to install it.

### Fixed
- Before setup, Local AI no longer opens a password prompt that shows the plugin's path and arguments: a start or stop says to set up Local AI instead, so every prompt it shows has fixed wording.

## [6.3.2] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- Running the same model on two cards at once no longer corrupts its download: the second waits ("waiting for the other download of these weights") and then uses the checked files, instead of a second download appending to the same partial file until the checksum fails and the model never loads.

## [6.3.1] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- A long model format no longer runs over the model's name in a card's model list (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next's did), and a header fact longer than the line wraps inside the panel.

### Changed
- A card's model list says only whether each model fits: "fits" on the card alone, "+75 GB RAM" for a model that also takes system RAM, or what the machine lacks ("needs 96 GB RAM"). Format and context show on the page once a model is chosen, and an offload model's page shows the RAM it takes.

## [6.3.0] - 2026-09-29

- First-run setup is available inside Local AI, including password prompts and NVIDIA container support. No separate script command is needed after installing the plugin.
- Refresh models asks for permission to update the model catalog using a dedicated polkit description.
- Setup checks Docker through sudo, leaves configured runtimes alone, and refuses to restart Docker with running containers.

## [6.2.2] - 2026-09-29

### Fixed
- A plugin update brings its recipes again after an earlier "Refresh models": the refreshed catalog is read only while it is newer than the bundled recipes, so a 6.2.0 refresh no longer hides the models an update adds (Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on the RTX 3090 in 6.2.1).

## [6.2.1] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- Qwen3.8-Flash-Next on one RTX 3090, with vision: a 180B MoE with its experts in RAM (75 GB free RAM) and its n-gram table read from NVMe (85 GB of weights), after the card's other models. Validated on the owner's 3090 through this plugin's own start (all six lab gates, 50.7 tok/s, 166K-token context). Recipes from the registry at df2fbf0b.

## [6.2.0] - 2026-09-29

- Refresh the published registry from the panel without reinstalling; keep the previous catalog on failure.
- Remove stopped model downloads, protecting weights shared with managed running models.
- Keep day details beneath the activity chart and stop the grid at today.

### Added
- Recipes that keep part of the model in system RAM and on disk say what the machine needs besides the card (the registry's `needs`: `host_ram_gb` of available RAM, `disk_gb` free under the models folder, and `fast_storage: "nvme"`), and Local AI offers them only where it has that. The backend reads MemAvailable, the free space under `~/.cache/omarchy/local-ai/models`, and whether that folder is on an NVMe drive, following LUKS and LVM (Omarchy's `/dev/mapper/root`) down to the drive. A recipe the machine cannot run is never a card's pick or a group's; Config lists it greyed out with the reason ("needs 68 GB RAM, you have 31"), and `run` refuses it with the same words. Weights already downloaded and checked need no more disk, and a download under way (or weights linked in from another copy) needs only what is left. Recipes without `needs` are unchanged.

## [6.1.8] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed
- A machine with nvidia-utils but no working NVIDIA driver (an AMD or Intel box, or a driver update whose kernel modules are out of step) no longer breaks the panel. nvidia-smi prints its failure on stdout, and that text was read as a card, so the snapshot failed and the bar had nothing to draw. Only real card rows count now (#18, thanks @AlucarDWeb).

### Changed
- Recipes from the registry at b94e4255. Most NVIDIA cards gain a second and third pick: Gemma 4 12B on 8-12 GB cards, Qwen3.8-27B at 32K on 12 GB cards, Qwen3.5-9B and Gemma 4 26B A4B on 16-48 GB cards, Qwen3.6-35B-A3B on the RTX 3090, 5090 and 6000 Ada. The RTX PRO 6000 now leads with Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (165 tok/s), then Qwen3.8-27B NVFP4 at 256K and Qwen3.6-35B-A3B. The RX 7600 XT adds Qwen3.8-27B with MTP at 64K (thanks @AlucarDWeb).
- Regression tests for a stale NVIDIA CDI spec (#17) and for AMD cards as amd-smi 7.2 lists them (#12).
- The daily registry sync passes main's required test check instead of being refused.

## [6.1.7] - 2026-09-26

### Changed
- Recipes from the new registry at a908edb: every card's recipe passed the lab's six checks (load, chat, reasoning, tools, 85% context recall, speed) on the real card or its sibling, or is the one validated before the lab. EXL3 Qwen now runs on the RTX 3060 Ti, 3070, 3070 Ti, 3080, 4060, 4060 Ti 8GB, 5060 and 5060 Ti 8GB, where there was only LFM2.5 with reasoning off.
- "See supported cards" opens https://local.sybilsolutions.ai.

## [6.1.6] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed
- Hermes opens on the running model. It takes its endpoint from its own `config.yaml` and ignores `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, so it used to start on whatever provider that file named. It now starts with `--provider custom`, `--model` and `CUSTOM_BASE_URL` for this session only: its `config.yaml`, memory and sessions are untouched, and only the gateway key is sent (thanks @Zodomo on omacom/omarchy#13036).

## [6.1.5] - 2026-09-25

### Fixed
- A start on an NVIDIA card whose CDI spec (`/etc/cdi/nvidia.yaml`) names device numbers that no longer match `/dev` now stops at once with the command that regenerates it, instead of loading until the 30-minute limit: Docker passes the cards through that spec, and after a driver update moved `/dev/nvidia-uvm` the engine saw no CUDA device (#17, thanks @carlbme).
- The activity grid files tokens under the local calendar day, so a daylight-saving change no longer moves an hour into the day before or after (the same bug @saitakarcesme found in the 5.x telemetry, #16).

## [6.1.4] - 2026-09-25

### Changed
- A faster snapshot: 5 jq runs instead of 29, about 130 ms instead of 220 ms on a machine with four GPUs and a running model. Each running model is read once and joined to its recipe in the last step, the GPU listings are parsed where they are matched, and a usage log that has not changed since its summary is not read again.
- The panel draws fewer frames: the border glow steps ten times a second and the Coming soon wave twenty, instead of sixty frames each, which is a quarter of the rendering while the panel is open on home. The glow runs only while a chart is on screen and the activity grid keeps its squares across refreshes.
- The log keeps its last 5,000 lines once it passes 1 MB.

### Fixed
- A model without a shipped logo (Gemma) no longer logs a missing-file warning each time its page is drawn.

## [6.1.3] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- The listing's preview shows the 6.1 panel: home with your activity and the running models, a running model's page, and a card's Config with its models.

## [6.1.2] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- Recipes at registry 0362dbdf: the Arc Pro B70's recommended Qwen3.8-27B EXL3 runs on exl3xpu 86276b00 with exact 1600-token KV blocks, 4096-token prefill chunks and prefix caching (272,570 KV tokens; thinking on, 16 streams 344-410 tok/s, up from about 295-349; a repeated 14K-token prompt answers in 1.8 s instead of 11.1 s).

## [6.1.1] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- The store description and README say what 6.1 does: validated models per card, the recommended one first, and groups across cards.

## [6.1.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added
- Home leads with your lifetime: all-time tokens and requests over an activity grid of the last 20 weeks (a column a week, a row a weekday, each day shaded by its tokens), whether or not a model runs; hovering a day shows its date and tokens. A first run, with no answers yet, has none.
- A card's Config lists every model validated for it (the bundle now carries every recipe of the registry, 97 instead of 40), the recommended one checked; choosing another changes the page and what Run starts. A group's page does the same for models validated on that many cards.
- Groups: one model across several free cards of a kind, as their own row under AVAILABLE (e.g. "2 × RTX 3090") with Run and a Config page. `run <recipe> <gpu>,<gpu>` checks every card and gives the engine exactly those.
- An "all GPUs" page: every card as home's rows, so any of them, busy ones too, opens to its buttons and Config.

### Changed
- Buttons say what they do: "View logs" and "Stop model". A crashed row opens to Run again, View logs and Config; dismiss is on the row itself.
- The Hugging Face logo, in one colour, marks a model's weights.
- A group (one model across several free cards of a kind) is its own row under AVAILABLE, e.g. "2 × RTX 3090", with Run and a Config page for the group; a single GPU's row no longer offers groups.
- Icons instead of dotted lists: a model's page shows its format, cards, context, vision and size as icon chips; agent (a terminal prompt), folder, this machine and tailnet rows lead with an icon,; agent and folder open with a chevron and mark the chosen one with a check. A running card reads "Arc Pro B70  32 GB", with speed and tokens as icons in its corner.
- With no card to run on, the panel shows a thin square wave drifting left instead of a chip.
- Home is running and available: running models as cards (tall, with their token line drawn dim, speed and tokens small in the bottom-right corner), then the available GPUs as rows, free ones first, then crashed ones. A GPU already running a model is not listed again; cards another program holds or with no model are behind "all GPUs".
- A GPU row has one quick action on the right (run its model, or run again after a crash, with dismiss beside it); clicking the row opens it: its details or crash reason, then buttons like a model card's: Run (or Run again), Run on N cards, Config, Log, Dismiss (dismiss stops it, freeing the card).
- Model cards sit a little above the page, with a slow glow on their border; "now" sits at the chart's right edge. A vision model shows an eye on its page.
- The tailnet address stays hidden, small and dim, until clicked; "copy" is always beside it and copies it in one click.
- The header shows a smaller, dimmer version. Loading reads "loading".
- A model's page is the same for a running model and a free card: its token line and figures appear when it runs, its cards are the GPUS section (ticked to choose which a free one runs on), then Run or Log and Stop.
- The token line runs from the first answer to the last, so the latest growth sits at the right edge; its right label says how long ago that was.

### Removed
- Unused snapshot fields (`unsupported`, a kind's name, most of a group's fields) and the panel's dead row types.

### Fixed
- A snapshot no longer re-reads every usage log: each model keeps a summary beside its log (tokens per hour, counts and sums for the averages) that only reads the lines added since. With a million requests logged, a snapshot takes about 0.1 s instead of 5 s; the first read of an existing large log builds the summary once, 100,000 lines at a time.
- `run` refuses a recipe on a card of another kind.
- The panel flickered on every refresh: its rows were rebuilt each time. They now update in place.

## [6.0.3] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- A design pass on the panel by Gil Rodrigues (0xSero/omarchy#2): every text and line colour is solved for an APCA contrast target from the active theme (the model's name and the primary action 90, values 80, labels 60, lines 15), so any theme stays readable; text starts and ends on one gutter; two type sizes; secondary buttons are outlined in the same ink as the primary fill.
- Home lists the running models, then the other cards under a GPUS heading: free cards with their run action, cards held by another program, cards with no validated model yet. Figure labels are lower case; a model's capabilities are one line.

## [6.0.2] - 2026-09-24

### Changed
- The password prompt says what it is for: "Local AI needs your password to start a model on your GPU", "to stop a model", "to change what your tailnet can reach", "to remove its models, containers and engines", instead of the backend's full path and arguments. `bin/omarchy-install-ai-local` installs `local-ai.policy` (the same polkit actions Omarchy's own Local AI ships) pointed at this plugin's backend; `bin/omarchy-remove-ai-local` removes it.
- The backend's privileged phases are `__start`, `__stop`, `__share` and `__purge`, one first argument each, so polkit can tell them apart.

## [6.0.1] - 2026-09-24

### Fixed
- A model a 5.x install left running showed as another program's, holding its card with nothing able to stop it. It is now taken over on the first snapshot: it shows as running and Stop takes it down.
- On a machine with two cards of the same kind, the free card's Run failed with "already running". A second copy of the model now runs on it, on its own port.
- A second copy's load percentage reached 95 in a minute and sat there; loads are now paced by the recipe's last load on any card.
- A snapshot the panel cannot read is shown as an error instead of as a machine with no GPU.
- Intel cards show how much memory they have instead of an estimate of what is used; the xe driver does not report it.

### Changed
- The bar mark is nine dots: faint when idle, lit when a model is ready, red when one failed, a ripple while one starts.
- No supported GPU is one line, a drawn chip and the link to the supported cards.

### Recipes
- Intel Arc Pro B70: the same Qwen3.8-27B recipe on the newer exl3xpu engine image (faster batched decode).
- RTX 4090: Qwen3.8-27B EXL3 on SGLang, the RTX 3090 recipe, in place of TabbyAPI.

### Added
- CI builds the panel's views from the backend's own snapshots under node, and scans the tree for secrets with gitleaks.

## [6.0.0] - 2026-09-23

Version 6 is a rebuild: the same files proposed for Omarchy itself in omacom/omarchy#13036, one bash backend, one view model, one panel and one data file. A model 5.x left running is taken over on the first snapshot: it shows as running and Stop takes it down.

### Changed
- One validated model per card. `recipes.json` is the first recipe of each card kind in the registry's export (EXL3 on SGLang or vLLM first), 36 card kinds, one per line. On an RTX 3090 that is Qwen3.8-27B on SGLang at 200K context with CUDA graphs on.
- The backend is `bin/omarchy-local-ai` alone. `run <recipe> <gpu>` claims a card and a port, then a detached worker downloads and checks the weights, starts the engine and the gateway, and sends one request to confirm the model answers at GPU speed. Each step is a line on the card and a notification says when it starts, is ready, or failed and why; loading shows a percentage paced by the last load.
- Without the docker group, a start, stop or share is one `pkexec` of this file; as root it takes the caller from `PKEXEC_UID`, re-reads and checks the recipe, and mounts only plain paths the caller owns. Engines run with `no-new-privileges`.
- The panel: one row per running model with its all-time token line, speed and tokens, and Open and More; a dashed row per free card kind that runs its model in one click; a bordered warning for a card another program holds or one with no validated model; Coming soon with the list of supported cards when nothing here can run. More shows the chart, six figures (decode, prefill, first token, session, week, up), the cards, the agent and folder, links to the weights and where the model answers.
- Agents: pi (the default), Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, omp, Crush, Grok, Copilot and Hermes. The last agent and folder picked become the default; the last six folders are offered again.
- Share on the tailnet with `tailscale serve`, tailnet only and still keyed.
- Speeds are averages over every run of the model, from the gateway's usage log.

### Removed
- `CardRow.qml`, the stats and open pages, keyboard navigation, the `load`/`unload`/`agent` verbs and the Model.js node test. The ori, agy, muse and cursor agents are not offered.

## [5.4.0] - 2026-09-22

### Added
- Omarchy's native Local AI tab is generated from this plugin instead of copied by hand. `make native OMARCHY=<checkout>` writes its row data, row component and token bars from `ui/`, `make native-check` fails when the copy has drifted, and `test/native` checks the same contract without a checkout. A card change is now made once here and published with one command.
- `native/backend-command.js` holds the one part of the native view that is native to it: resolving the installed controller from Omarchy's plugin registry.

### Changed
- The native view's backend gate requires 5.4.0 or newer, so it runs only against a controller whose rows it was generated from. `test/native` covers the boundary: 5.4.0, 5.4.1 and 5.10.0 launch, 5.3.7 and everything older or newer does not, and a missing backend never does.
- `recipes.json` is now taken verbatim from the registry's published export (`make sync`), and `make check` fails when the vendored copy has fallen behind it, so the registry is the only place a recipe is authored. `make sync-check` compares the two with the two provenance fields removed, so a registry re-stamp is not drift while a withdrawn or changed recipe still is, and it names the cards that differ. It reads the registry's *published* export — the file committed at its `origin/main`, not whatever a checkout has in its working tree, which can be ahead of it or behind it — and falls back to the working-tree file only when there is no such ref. `test/sync` covers all three cases without a registry checkout. The plugin's CI checks out the registry to run that comparison, a daily job commits the export when it moves, and the release runs the same checks before it publishes — the same export the plugin already stages at runtime, so an installed plugin sees new recipes without waiting for a release. 82 recipes across 37 cards now, five more than 5.2.0's catalog.
- Each model is one row on a GPU page, and that row is the action: **Download & run**, **Load**, **Resume & load**, **Load another** or **Swap**, naming its size, with its context and capabilities beside it. Selecting a model no longer reveals a separate button underneath, and a model whose load would replace a running one names the models being replaced in its own row.
- A GPU page no longer repeats the card as a row. Its title and breadcrumb already name the card, so the per-card state moves into the subtitle.

### Validation
- The 128 KiB fixture asserts that the snapshot names the recipe file it used rather than a stamp from that file, so a registry refresh cannot break it.
- The suite now reads the same on jq 1.6 (Ubuntu 22.04, Pop!_OS) and on 1.7+: its argv conversion drops the trailing field only when it is empty, because jq 1.6 strips the final NUL in `-Rsc` where 1.7 and later keep it.
- The click suite passes on Omarchy: 42 scroll cases, 2 hit-area cases, 2 flow cases and 2 breadcrumb cases, no failures.

### Fixed
- `manifest.json`'s `description` — the listing's own words — names the supported hardware and the validated recipe count again: 82 recipes across 37 cards, NVIDIA RTX 30/40/50, RTX Ada, RTX Pro Blackwell, Intel Arc Pro B70 and AMD ROCm. 5.2.0 replaced the paragraph that named them with one that did not, and the listing reads this field at the published commit.
- Every `Text` in `ui/CardRow.qml` and `ui/TokenTotal.qml` whose `text` is not a bare literal now declares `textFormat: Text.PlainText`. Omarchy's own scan requires it, and the native copies already did: `Text.AutoText` promotes a string that looks like markup and fetches `<img src>` from it, and a model name, a device label, a share URL or a refusal sentence can carry the opening `<`.

## [5.3.7] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Keep a running recipe available when another GPU can host it. Load another instance with a separate endpoint, without stopping the first model.
- Expose only assigned Intel render devices so a launch on GPU 1 cannot fall back to the busy GPU 0.
- Track deployment instances separately from recipe identity, preserving targeted agent launch, restart, unload, rollback and recipe running status.

## [5.3.6] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Make the whole actionable row clickable, including indented choices and device meters; nested Copy buttons activate only their own action.
- Offer Swap model when a selected model needs occupied GPUs. Show which running models will be replaced, then use the controller's existing load and rollback path. Models on other GPUs keep running.

## [5.3.5] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Reveal capacity guidance when selecting a model while its GPUs are occupied, matching the automatic reveal of an available Load action.

## [5.3.4] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Give every GPU row the same destination: its running models and compatible model list. Remove the duplicate Models / Stats & agents navigation buttons; use the direct breadcrumb links to move between levels.
- Put a selected model's details and Load action immediately below that model, revealing the action on selection. Running models open directly and appear only once; remove the disconnected picker footer.
- Keep the home agent-launch action visible even when its configuration is collapsed, with the selected model shown above it.

## [5.3.3] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Scroll the full standalone page, including headers, folder editing and footer actions; use the native Agents viewport when embedded. Add Home/End and Page Up/Down, reveal keyboard selections, and clamp scrolling after resize.
- Make every breadcrumb a direct link, wrapping on narrow screens. Clicking the current destination also returns to the top. Allow browsing during deployment work with a visible return-to-progress action and conflicting operations disabled.
- Add native wheel, keyboard and breadcrumb regression checks across both presentations and three viewport sizes.

## [5.3.2] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Separate deployment management from token reporting. The overview shows stable GPU deployment rows with the running model, visible status, and explicit Manage or Load model actions.
- Move historical token totals into a separate read-only section below deployments. Usage bars no longer launch model controls or take keyboard focus; hide the section when no usage has been recorded.

## [5.3.1] - 2026-09-21

### Fixed
- Lead the overview with historical GPU token totals using the same filled-row geometry, typography and colors as the native Claude/Codex model totals. Remove the separate activity graphs; zero and unavailable usage remain compact rows.
- Backfill retained vLLM and llama.cpp logs plus attributable older gateway receipts, including models no longer running. Avoid overlapping receipts, preserve totals across unloads and midnight, and read new log output incrementally.
- Mark vLLM totals as estimates from rounded runtime rates. Keep today's generated-token count and non-zero runtime speed averages in model details, and show today's count with GPU status on hover.

## [5.3.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Compact token activity graphs under each GPU group in the overview. Each has a fixed 24-hour axis, observed-token total and a time/value readout on hover.
- Fifteen-minute token buckets collected by the existing ten-second telemetry cache. Histories survive model unloads and reset at local midnight; a multi-GPU model is counted once per group. Earlier unrecorded intervals remain blank.

## [5.2.0] - 2026-09-21

### Added
- Optional Local AI tab inside the native Agents panel, using its typography, section headers and separators. The overview has a compact agent launcher and one status row per GPU type; expand or open a model for details.
- Agent, running-model and project-folder selection at the top of the overview and model view. GPU groups remain browsable while occupied.
- NVIDIA, Intel Level Zero/DRM and AMD sysfs telemetry adapters with temperature, usage and VRAM meters in model details. Missing sensors show N/A.
- Incremental vLLM and llama.cpp statistics: today's average non-zero decode/prefill log samples and generated-token counter deltas, with a shared ten-second cache. Other engines show unavailable statistics.
- Optional Mac/Moonlight bindings and a separate OS status-bar shortcut button with an offline visual guide. The integration installer backs up user configuration and leaves system files untouched.

### Fixed
- Show share URLs in a fixed full-panel overlay until copied or closed; keep failures and actions visible above the fold.
- Enter the selected project directory inside the terminal after UWSM starts it; explicitly allow OMP to run in home instead of relocating to a temporary directory.
- Pass Pi's thinking option as separate arguments and set OpenCode's main and small model in its launch configuration.
- Replace acceptance-only token totals and fixed acceptance speeds with runtime measurements. The first day's token count starts when tracking begins.
- Add telemetry and all eleven agent handoff checks to the shipped-bundle tests; include integration assets in the release archive.

### Validation boundaries
- Pi, OpenCode and Crush terminal startup was checked on the mixed NVIDIA/Intel desktop; all eleven launch adapters have fixture coverage. Startup is not full conversation or tool acceptance for every agent.
- NVIDIA and Intel telemetry was checked on hardware. AMD has fixture coverage and still needs physical-device acceptance.
- The final compact layout passed row-data and QML loading checks; final visual acceptance remains open. The offline guide's browser rendering also remains unverified.

## [5.1.0] - 2026-09-17

### Added
- One update row on the card's home, and one verb behind it. A background check — at most once per six hours, never on the card's critical path — reads the registry's recipes and this repository's own `manifest.json`, stages what is newer, and adopts nothing; the row says `v5.1.1 + 3 for your card ›` when something is staged. `omarchy-local-ai update` applies the staged registry copy and then updates the harness through Omarchy's own `omarchy plugin update <id> --yes`. `update --check` fetches and stages only.
- Analytics: the daily `traffic` workflow now records every release asset's cumulative `download_count`, a per-day interaction tally (stars, forks, watchers, issues, PRs, discussions, commits on the default branch) from one GraphQL call, and the repository snapshot with its date archived inside the file, so a star timeline is derivable. [17 — Stats](https://0xsero.github.io/omarchy-local-ai/#17-stats) renders `traffic/summary.json` live.

### Changed
- The registry copy is no longer adopted silently. The background check only stages it (`$STATE/recipes.next.json`) and reports what it holds — whether a newer copy is waiting, how many recipes it adds, and how many of those are for the cards actually detected. A newer copy that changes recipes without adding any still reads as staged, so it can be applied from the card. What runs is the marketplace-reviewed vendored file until the user applies the update. `recipes update` still fetches and adopts in one step.

### Fixed
- `traffic.yml`'s jq program had been invalid since `d6828f9`, so the scheduled run of 2026-09-17 failed and the daily record had been reporting only clones and views. The step now runs with `pipefail`, so a failing `gh` fails the run instead of letting jq turn an error body into zeroed counters. Its `actions/checkout` is pinned by commit like the repository's other workflows.

### Internal
- `OMARCHY_AI_RECIPES_TTL` becomes `OMARCHY_AI_UPDATE_TTL` (it now clocks both checks); `OMARCHY_AI_UPDATE=0` or an empty `OMARCHY_AI_MANIFEST_URL` turns the release check off. `recipes_autorefresh` is replaced by `upstream_autocheck`, and the repository root is computed once in `lib/common.sh`.
- Recipe files reach jq as file inputs, never as arguments: the published `recipes.json` is past the 128 KiB cap Linux puts on one argument, so passing its contents would have failed every snapshot on Omarchy. Adopting a staged copy now re-validates the file it is about to move, so a check that races an update cannot downgrade the file in use.

## [5.0.7] - 2026-09-17

### Changed
- The marketplace listing: `preview.png` now carries the Local AI banner, the supported GPUs, recipe count, agents and sharing, and two live captures of the card (Qwen3.8-27B on 2× RTX 3090 and on 2× Arc Pro B70). The description names the supported GPU families and the agents outright. `docs/preview.py` composes the image from `media/banner.png` and two captures.

## [5.0.6] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- The README's rented-card link pointed at `test/rented-results/`, which is measurement data and lives outside the repository; the wiki named the wrong manifest version and library count, and overstated what a GitHub source archive carries; `docs/preview.py` hardcoded one home directory in its font lookup.

### Internal
- `agent_dialect()` and `container_recipe()` were defined and called nowhere; removed.

## [5.0.5] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- Keep OMP image attachments in PNG/JPEG using its supported WebP exclusion setting. Local llama.cpp decoders do not support WebP; the same image passed as PNG but produced incorrect answers as WebP.

- Require image blocks in live image-test requests and reject Codex shell workarounds during vision acceptance.

## [5.0.4] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- Preserve image attachments through the Claude Messages and Codex Responses gateway routes, including images returned by Claude's file reader.
- Configure Grok as a custom local model with the selected model, endpoint, context and key. A cloud proxy override could retain Grok's cloud model and OAuth credentials.
- Pass image support to OpenCode and Crush, and the selected context window to OpenCode and Codex.
- Resolve Crush's installed binary before changing its configuration directory, including Omarchy's mise install wrapper.

### Added
- `test/agents` exercises installed agents against ready models with real text, file read/write/verification and image requests. Evidence stays outside the repository; failed tool calls remain failures even when an agent recovers.

## [5.0.3] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- OMP uses the serving model's default reasoning settings instead of inferring an unsupported effort from its name. Refresh its migrated YAML configuration on every launch so switching models uses the selected model and endpoint.
- Pin the corrected gateway: rejected streaming requests retain their HTTP status and error body instead of appearing as successful empty streams.

## [5.0.2] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- The marketplace listing gets its image and its words back. `preview.png` returns to the repository root, cut from a live capture of the v5 card by `docs/preview.py`, and `manifest.json` carries a description that names what the card actually does. 5.0.1 removed the preview and the old description, which would have published a listing with no image and a v4 paragraph.

## [5.0.1] - 2026-09-16

### Fixed
- Remove demo recordings, recording scripts, logos and the obsolete preview from the repository. Embed the tiny vision/video readiness inputs in the controller so those checks need no loose media files.
- Keep UI source in `ui/` and design documentation in `docs/`.
- Publish a runtime-only archive and run the full test suite against its unpacked contents. Exclude development files from source archives as well.

## [5.0.0] - 2026-09-16

### Changed
- Run several models at once on separate GPU groups. Each has its own engine, gateway and port; starting a model replaces only models on the GPUs it claims, with rollback if acceptance fails.
- Home groups running models beneath their GPU type and marks occupied GPUs locked. Free GPU groups open the recipe picker, with a GPU-count selector and download, resume or run actions.
- Model details show decode and prefill speed, tokens today, KV capacity, context, GPU telemetry and capabilities, plus agent selection, sharing and Stop.
- Expand to a full-screen view from any page. The compact/full-screen control and F11 switch views without losing your selection; Escape returns to compact first.
- Qwen3.8 TP2 recipes use verified 262,144-token context on two RTX 3090s or two Arc Pro B70s. Context and chat, vision, video, tools and reasoning capabilities appear before launch; unknown metadata stays unknown. Pi/OMP and Crush receive recipe context, and Pi/OMP receive image support.
- Recipes update from the registry, including supported multi-card recipes. Existing local weights are reused only after verification against the pinned Hub revision.
- A single-GPU recipe prefers the free GPU with most available memory. vLLM memory utilization accounts for memory occupied by the desktop.

### Fixed
- The dot grid has a clear, continuous breathing animation while the panel is open.
- Agent and Stop buttons stay inside the screen on short displays and when the agent picker expands; only the body scrolls.
- Launch no longer silently retries at a smaller context. Acceptance checks runtime context and exercises advertised image/video input through the gateway.
- Deleted weights are downloaded again even if an old downloaded marker remains.
- Crashing engines report their failure promptly, with logs retained for diagnosis. Worker locking no longer leaves phantom operations or adopts a model during its own start.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-09-12

### Changed
- Docker without the docker group: Start, Stop and Share batch their docker calls into one polkit prompt through Omarchy's own agent; the NVIDIA container toolkit is installed inside that prompt when missing. The card's refresh never touches docker.
- The root phase trusts pkexec, not user-owned files: uid from `PKEXEC_UID`, every root derived from that user's home, inputs pinned by hashes on pkexec's own command line.
- Acceptance refuses a reasoning model whose thinking leaks into the answer; the four Qwen TabbyAPI recipes enable the reasoning parser.
- Claude launches with `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, the bearer form meant for gateways.
- Every failure is a sentence on the card: missing tools, a broken recipes file, a worker killed without its exit trap, a gateway that stops, a controller that prints nothing. Ready requires the acceptance record.
- Gate: recipe ids, repositories, weight directories and served names are shaped; the gateway image must be digest-pinned; only tailnet addresses are bound; a same-named docker network of someone else's is refused; `share --key -` reads the key from stdin.
- Sharing: a failed publish falls back to loopback inside the same prompt; a dismissed Stop-sharing prompt keeps the card saying shared.
- Card: no dead 20 seconds after a pick; a running model of another recipe is named and Start replaces it.
- Listing: preview with how it works in three steps; vector logo under `media/`; README rewritten.

### Fixed
- The root-phase env parser dropped values containing `x`, `6` or `0`, so the gateway and downloader ran as root behind a prompt.
- Prompt-mode acceptance called docker as the user, reporting a slow-loading engine as exited.
- An engine that failed to start left the previous model set aside; rollback now happens in the same prompt, and a failed rollback is named.
- A lock loser could rewrite the winner's ledger; the parent's pending record is a compare-and-swap.

### Internal
- 112 shimmed tests; the docker shim refuses unprivileged calls in prompt mode and the pkexec shim starts from a clean environment.
- Clone and view traffic recorded daily on the `stats` branch.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-09-08

The snapshot verified on the Omarchy plugin marketplace (`3f447b9`). One validated model per GPU, one button on the bar; agents launch-only, nothing written to user config; keyed sharing on the tailnet; the GPU picker; rented-hardware validation of 29 NVIDIA recipes.
